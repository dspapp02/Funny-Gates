### Overview:

This project started as a simple piece of trial code for me to learn and use Git and GitHub. It also serves as a user-friendly(ish) tool for implementing basic logic gates and circuits in Python.

### Installation Instructions:

To install this package directly from GitHub, use the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/dspapp02/Funny-Gates
```

### Features:

Currently, the code allows you to run logic gates and print out truth tables. I am still missing some miscallaneous additions, such as documentation, but that should be done in the near future. 

As I continue to grow as a scientist and programmer, I hope to introduce additional features. Ideas currently on the table include:

- Functionality to build reversible versions of irreversible gates.
- Constructing gates directly from truth tables.

### Motivation:

I was inspired to build this while reading through Thomas Wong's Introduction to Quantum and Classical Computing, which encouraged readers to use Verilog to build circuits and see them in action. Since I wasn't particularly interested in learning that language, I decided to implement the logic gates in Python instead. When I started learning Git, I thought I could use this program as a trial to see what I could do, and it evolved and expanded from there.

### Feedback:

I'm open to any feedback on my coding style, especially since I don't have a formal background in computing beyond what I've been given as a physicist. Suggestions for improving efficiency, readability, or additional functionality are more than welcome!
